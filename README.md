# project10_full_stack_app

### A full stack application with a REST API built using Express and SQLite, and React for the client.

This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. Users are required to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
